    <header><h1>Chatbot for Pracuj.pl Group</h1></header>
    <summary><p>Customers, trying to find a job, wrote on the fanpage Pracuj.pl, which so far has played mainly an image role. Our goal was find a solution to help their customers in an interesting and engaging way, which would further relieve the customer service team of the burden of responding to such inquiries.</p></summary>
    <p>
        We set ourselves the task of designing a virtual assistant for jobseekers within 7 weeks. This involved creating a personality and logic for the chatbot. We had to answer the questions that showed us the way through the design process:
    </p>
    <p><b>When will he be needed?</b><br/>
      Find contexts for using a chatbot.</p>
      <p><b>Why will he be needed?</b><br/>
        Find his role and problems it should solve</p>
      <p><b>When he will be needed?</b><br/>
          Find contexts for using a chatbot.</p>
      <p><b>Who he will be needed?</b><br/>
            Design a proper personality.</p>
      <p><b>Who he will be talking to?</b><br/>
            Create an user persona.</p>
      <p><b>How should he work?</b><br/>
            Create logic.</p>

      <p> We decided that chatbot will work in easy linear loops that won't make it too expensive to develop and will be hard to get lost in conversation. During problematic moments like setting advanced preferences, we decided that chatbot will open a webview window with mobile screen. That way we connected the conversational and personalised experience with benefits of using classic forms known from Pracuj.pl website</p>

      <p>I was project lead, and I was responsible for UX/UI, strategy and research</p>
