    <header><h1>Provident Mobile App</h1></header>
    <summary><p>The task was to design an application for  Provident Polska, payday loan company. The process consisted of a research phase, an idea phase and a design phase.</p></summary>

    <p>During the research phase we met with loan holders to learn about their biggest problems, concerns, needs and possible blockers that would prevent them from using the application. We learned that users will often be people with low knowledge of the digital world, rarely installing new applications and very sensitive to leakage of personal data.
    </p>
    <p>On the Provident Polska side, we had to handle many untypical situations, which on a daily basis were handled by field representatives. The installments were often paid at irregular intervals, also the loan agreement allowed to negotiate the amount of the installment depending on the financial situation. We also met with fears that the application could take the work away from the current employees.</p>
    <p>We designed mobile app, which was supporting the work of advisors and also helping loan holders to supervise their finances and additional insurance and medical products they often bought with loans.</p>
    <p>One of the biggest challenges was designing a registration process which would be both safe and easy to complete.</p>

    <p>I was project co-lead, and I was responsible for strategy, research, UX/UI and illustrations</p>
