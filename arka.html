    <header><h1>BZWBK ARKA Investment Funds</h1></header>
    <summary><p>Investment funds in the transaction service BZWBK24 were a product which was difficult to sell. A small number of people made transactions themselves using available online channels. Few clients who decided to buy it needed the help of an advisor.
    </p></summary>
    <p>After research we discovered that the term "investment fund" was incomprehensible to clients - associated with large money, risk and uncertainty of profit. Additionally, a lot of bad emotions related to the previous financial crisis appeared. Some clients knew people who lost money, trusting that fund valuations will always grow. All these factors aroused fear in potential interested parties and made the investment fund a product difficult to sell.</p>

    <p>During testing with users it turned out that the old platform was diffcult to use. Persons interested in the funds expected a presentation of the offer by the advisor and support at the further stages of the purchase. There was a kind of psychological and technological blockade,which caused a large number of customers to leave the service.</p>

      <p>The research and workshops with the client's team clearly showed us how the platform should work. Main change was step by step guide for the first time buyers where everything was explained with details. In order to get rid of negative emotions, we have created a system of goals in which the user could invest. Then we focused on a clear navigation and start screen, which allowed user to quickly check the situation (portfolio status). We also added guide content for less conscious and distrustful clients, and for more advanced users we created a fund comparison tool.</p>

      <p> We designed investment tool that encouraged the users to buy funds on their own without the support of a consultant, offering online help at every stage. A lot of attention was paid to user-friendly language and clear communication, which is particularly important in the case of difficult banking products. </p>
